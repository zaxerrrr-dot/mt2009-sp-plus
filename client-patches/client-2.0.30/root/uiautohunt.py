# Auto Hunt System
# Created by SIZOWSKI (Thank you for the original code! Go subscribe to him on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/@metin2singleplayer a.k.a "ZAXEP - METIN2 SINGLE PLAYER")
# Modernized by Colide (Uriel).
#
# MT2009_PLUS_UPSTREAM_2_0_76: rebased on the upstream client 2.0.76 (from
# 2.0.49 + the crowd escape): mounted hunting and "Bojowiec", the wall
# escape and the minute's skip list, the server's way round walls
# (/autohunt_path), buff/potion affects, focus loss. The pick-up stays
# MT2009 PLUS's own filter (uipickupfilter.py, below); upstream's "Bez
# bonusu" and "Filtr dla Z i `" are that filter's job here.
#
# Auto Lowy 2.0 (Colide, 22 September). The official system's features for
# free (pl-wiki, "System - Auto Lowy"): twelve skills on their own clocks
# (one cast at an enemy waits for the fight - see SELF_SKILLS below),
# six potions each under its own share of health or mana, twelve items on a
# clock, stones, standing up after death and walking back, and a pick-up
# by kind in a window of its own. New in 2.0: three switches for what is
# fought - Moby, Metiny, Bossy - which the server ranks boss, stone,
# monster (do_autohunt_target, playerbotify apply_auto_hunt_categories);
# a corpse is let go the moment this client sees it dead
# (player.IsTargetDead), because the server keeps it two or three seconds
# and named it again; a bow in the hand reaches from afar
# (player.IsBowEquipped); the range is drawn on the ground
# (player.SetAutoHuntRangeCircle) - three functions of the client 2.0.25
# exe, each asked with hasattr or under AttributeError, so an older exe
# hunts without them; the windows keep their places in autohunt/config.cfg
# and every character its own settings in autohunt/postacie/<name>.cfg.
#
# The client cannot list the monsters or the items round its character, so
# it asks the server:
#   "/autohunt_target <range> <stones> <dx> <dy> <mobs> <bosses> [<skip> [<nearest> [<skips> [<order>]]]]"
#     -> "AutoHuntTarget <vid> [<blocked>]"
# (<nearest> 1: the nearest monster plain, for a hunter boxed in - see
# COMBAT_STUCK_SECONDS; MT2009_PLUS_AUTOHUNT_CROWD_V1 in do_autohunt_target, and a server
# without it reads seven arguments and ignores the eighth. <skips>: the
# targets left for a minute, "123,456", at most TARGET_BLOCK_CAPACITY -
# apply_auto_hunt_skip_list; a server before it ignores the ninth.
# <order>: MT2009_PLUS_AUTOHUNT_PRIORITY_V1, the "Priorytet" of the settings
# window, 0 the nearest plain, 1-6 the orders of PRIORITY_LABELS; the ninth
# is then always sent, "0" for no skips. <blocked>: 1 when a wall or a rock
# stands on the straight line to the target - MT2009_PLUS_AUTOHUNT_BLOCKED_V1,
# the way round is then asked at once by /autohunt_path below; a server
# before it sends the VID alone.)
#   "/autohunt_mount <off|on>" -> "AutoHuntMount <off|on> <mounted>"
# (MT2009_PLUS_AUTOHUNT_MOUNT_V1: off and back on a mount that holds the
# hunter in place; both idempotent - a retry never undoes a late success.)
#   "/autohunt_loot <range> <kinds> <dx> <dy>" -> "AutoHuntLoot <vid> <dx> <dy>"
#   "/autohunt_path <seq> <vid> <dx> <dy>"
#     -> "AutoHuntPath <seq> <ok|direct|none|wait|off> <kind> [<dx>,<dy>;...]"
# (the way round a wall from the bots' route planner, and "AutoHuntPath 0
# hello <kind>" after the first target question a VID - see PATH_KIND_NONE;
# playerbotify apply_auto_hunt_paths, playerbot_autohunt.h.)
# Every place goes both ways as an offset from the character: this client
# counts positions from its map's corner and the server from the world's.
# Every time is clientclock.Now(): app.GetTime() starts again from zero at
# every warp, and a skill's or an item's next moment taken on the map
# before would have held it for as long as the character played there.
#
# Autologin (autologin.py): a switch in the "Ustawienia Walki" grid, saved
# per character. With it on, a game that drops is logged in again with the
# same account and character, and a hunt that was running goes on. The
# Hunter's CanUpdate is the one hook every frame of the game passes, so the
# autologin learns there that the game is open again, and Destroy - the game
# window closing - is where it hears that the game has gone.
#
# The pick-up's kinds are the pick-up filter's (uipickupfilter.py, one
# filter for the Z key, Auto Lowy and the companion, the operator, 30
# September): the "Podnoszenie" board shows and switches the same kinds as
# the Ctrl+Z window, and its "Filtr" the same switch. "Podnies" stays Auto
# Lowy's own - whether the hunt picks up at all. With the filter off the hunt
# picks up every kind; the per-character loot_* keys of the older files are
# read once, for a client with no filtr.cfg (Hunter.LoadConfig).
#
# MT2009_PLUS_AUTOHUNT_PICKUP_TOGGLE_V1: that switch is a row of its own at
# the top of the "Podnoszenie" board, "Autopodnoszenie: Wlaczone /
# Wylaczone" (the owner, 2 October). Off, the hunt asks no /autohunt_loot
# and picks nothing up (LootMask); the choice goes into the character's
# file at once (Hunter.SavePickupChoice), without the rest of the unsaved
# window.
#
# "Bojowiec" (Setnil, 1 October) is the hunt of a rider on a battle horse, a
# switch in the "Ustawienia Walki" grid: it stands where it is and swings as a
# held space bar does, picks up round itself by the window's kinds, casts the
# horse's own skills from the saddle and climbs down for a moment for the
# class's buffs, which no saddle lets anybody cast - the section "The rider"
# below says how and why. With the switch off, mounted hunting shares only
# the dismount/cast/remount cycle and keeps its normal movement and range.
#
# game.py registers the Hunter with its updateables, K opens the windows.
# Python 2.7 as the client has it, and 3 for tests/uiautohunt_test.py.
# Player-visible strings are CP1250 escapes, so the file itself is ASCII, and
# each is a Polish and English pair (playerbot_lang.T): English for a client
# set to any language but Polish. The labels of the module's tables are read
# once, at import - the client's language changes only with a restart.

#
# A player plays a battle horse standing in one place: the space bar held, a
# Cape of Courage on a clock pulling the pack in, the ` key for the drop. In
# the saddle the client refuses every skill but the horse's own with a word
# over the head (NOT_HORSE_SKILL, CPythonPlayer::__CheckSkillUsable) and the
# server refuses it anyway (CHARACTER::UseSkill; combat.md, "No skill of a
# class is cast from a saddle"), so the rider climbs down for its buffs - the
# warrior's Aura, Berserk and Strong Body, a Sura's or a Shaman's own - and
# gets back on, as the bots do (ManagePlayerBotCombatBuffs, reason=buff).
#
# What a horse allows is the horse's level, and the client knows it only as
# the riding skill's (130): the server keeps that skill at the horse's level
# (CHARACTER::SetHorseLevel) and sends it whenever the horse levels up
# (horse.advance, horse.set_level). From level 11 - the combat horse of the
# armoured horse book, 20104-20106 - the rider swings from the saddle
# (CInstanceBase::SHORSE::CanAttack); from 21 - the military horse - it casts
# the four horse skills too (SHORSE::CanUseSkill, and the server's
# CanUseHorseSkill: grade 3). Below 11 the switch changes nothing.
#
# Everything sent is what a player sends: the attack key and SetRotation for
# the swing, SetTarget for the mark, ClickSkillSlot for a cast, "/ride" for
# Ctrl+G - the server's do_ride stops riding a rider and seats one on foot on
# the summoned horse, and StopRiding summons the horse as a follower, so the
# way back is always there - and the ` key's "/pickup_nearby <kinds>" for
# the drop: every wanted item within the server's own 600 (CItem::
# DistanceValid), nearest first, forty at most, in one command, so the rider
# never walks to an item. It is sent only when "/autohunt_loot" names a
# wanted one within reach, or a window that makes the character busy
