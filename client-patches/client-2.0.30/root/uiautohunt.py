# Auto Hunt System
# Created by SIZOWSKI (Thank you for the original code! Go subscribe to him on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/@metin2singleplayer a.k.a "ZAXEP - METIN2 SINGLE PLAYER")
# Modernized by Colide & Uriel.
#
# Auto Lowy 2.0 (Colide, 22 September). The official system's features for
# free (pl-wiki, "System - Auto Lowy"): twelve skills on their own clocks
# (one cast at an enemy waits for the fight - see SELF_SKILLS below),
# six potions each under its own share of health or mana, twelve items on a
# clock, stones, standing up after death and walking back, and a pick-up
# by kind in a window of its own. New in 2.0: three switches for what is
# fought - Moby, Metiny, Bossy - which the server ranks boss, stone,
# monster (do_autohunt_target, playerbotify apply_auto_hunt_categories);
# a corpse is let go the moment this client sees it dead
# (player.IsTargetDead), because the server keeps it two or three seconds
# and named it again; a bow in the hand reaches from afar
# (player.IsBowEquipped); the range is drawn on the ground
# (player.SetAutoHuntRangeCircle) - three functions of the client 2.0.25
# exe, each asked with hasattr or under AttributeError, so an older exe
# hunts without them; the windows keep their places in autohunt/config.cfg
# and every character its own settings in autohunt/postacie/<name>.cfg.
#
# The client cannot list the monsters or the items round its character, so
# it asks the server:
#   "/autohunt_target <range> <stones> <dx> <dy> <mobs> <bosses> [<skip>]"
#     -> "AutoHuntTarget <vid>"
#   "/autohunt_loot <range> <kinds> <dx> <dy>" -> "AutoHuntLoot <vid> <dx> <dy>"
# Every place goes both ways as an offset from the character: this client
# counts positions from its map's corner and the server from the world's.
# Every time is clientclock.Now(): app.GetTime() starts again from zero at
# every warp, and a skill's or an item's next moment taken on the map
# before would have held it for as long as the character played there.
#
# Autologin (autologin.py): a switch in the "Ustawienia Walki" grid, saved
# per character. With it on, a game that drops is logged in again with the
# same account and character, and a hunt that was running goes on. The
# Hunter's CanUpdate is the one hook every frame of the game passes, so the
# autologin learns there that the game is open again, and Destroy - the game
# window closing - is where it hears that the game has gone.
#
# MT2009_PLUS_PICKUP_FILTER_V1: the pick-up panel is the player's own Z and `
# too while "Filtr dla Z i `" is on - the switch under the kinds, and the
# game options' "Podnoszenie" row ([Wszystko] [Filtr] [Ustaw], uigameoption.py)
# sets the same one and opens this window's settings with "Ustaw". The kinds
# go to the server as they change ("/pickup_filter <on> <kinds>",
# uipickupfilter.py), which applies them where Z, ` and a loot pet pick up
# (CHARACTER::PickupNearbyItems); a click on an item still takes anything.
# "Bez bonusu: nie" leaves on the ground a weapon, a piece of armour or a
# piece of jewellery with no bonus at all (LOOT_BONUS_ONLY), with the hunt and
# with Z and `; rings, belts and the rest go by their kind. The companion's
# "Filtr" (uisidekick.py) takes the same kinds, told again at every change
# (NotifyPickupKinds). The pick-up switches are kept the moment they are
# clicked, with no "Zapisz" (Hunter.SaveKeys).
#
# game.py registers the Hunter with its updateables, K opens the windows.
# Python 2.7 as the client has it, and 3 for tests/uiautohunt_test.py.
# Player-visible strings are CP1250 escapes, so the file itself is ASCII.
