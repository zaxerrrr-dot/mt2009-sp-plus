# Walking through one's own companion (26 September:
# "towarzysz jest dla naszej postaci nieblokujacym, zeby dalo sie przez niego
# przenikac, bo jak expi sie z nim to on strasznie przeszkadza").
#
# The collision between two characters is the client's alone:
# CInstanceBase::CheckAdvancing tests the main instance against every other
# one, and CActorInstance::TestActorCollision skips a victim whose actor type
# is NPC (ENABLE_NPC_WITHOUT_COLLISIONS in this client's GameLib). The server
# tells the owner's client which character its companion is
# (playerbot_sidekick.h, SendPlayerBotSidekickBody):
#
#   SidekickVid <vid>     - 0 once it has gone
#
# and the keeper below types that instance as an NPC - chr.SetInstanceType on
# the selected instance - whenever the client has made it anew, which it does
# every time the companion comes back into view. Nothing else of the instance
# changes. What an NPC's type also means in this client: a new hair or sash
# shows when it next comes into view, the minimap draws it as an NPC - and a
# click opens no player menu, because CPythonPlayer::OpenCharacterMenu, which
# both mouse buttons end in, returns for anything but a player. So under the
# cursor the companion is a player again (SetPicked, from game.py's picking,
# every frame): a click opens the menu - whisper, trade, guild - as it does
# for anybody else ("Na towarzysza nie dziala prawe klikniecie", Piciu713, 28
# September), and it is an NPC again, to be walked through, once the cursor
# has left it.
#
# Python 2.7 as the client has it; any exe of this line has the three chr
# calls, and one without them only loses the collision, never the game.
