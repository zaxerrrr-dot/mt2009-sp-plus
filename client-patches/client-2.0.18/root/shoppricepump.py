# The offline shop's "edit the price of similar items", one at a time - and
# then a look at what actually took.
#
# Ctrl + right click on a line of the shop's edit grid reprices every line
# holding the same item, and offlineshopmanage.py used to send one packet per
# line in the frame it was clicked in. The server takes one shop action per
# 200 ms (PulseManager, ePulse::IkaShopTouchItem), so the first line was
# repriced and every other one answered "wait a moment" - reported by
# uxietoszef and again by Nagash on 20 September, with a screenshot of the
# refusals. The same edits leave from here, one every TICK seconds.
#
# That was not the whole of it. "Zmienianie cen dziala ale potrafi ominac nawet
# pare itemow gdy ma sie ich duzo w sklepie" (blastyw, 20 September): spacing
# the packets out is still firing and forgetting, and a quarter of a second of
# the client's clock can arrive inside one 200 ms window of the server's after
# a slow frame or a late packet. One refused edit was then lost for good, and
# on a counter of thirty lines a couple always were.
#
# So the pump reads the reaction rather than counting the shots: when the queue
# drains it waits for the shop list the server sends back, compares the price
# of every line it touched with the price it asked for, and queues the ones
# that did not take again - PASSES times, and then it says in the chat what is
# left rather than leaving somebody to find it by eye.
#
# And it waits for the answers before it calls anything a miss. An edit is a
# round trip through the db core, and on a world of a thousand and more bots
# that core's queue took longer than the second and a half this gave it: every
# line still showed its old price, all of them were sent again, and after three
# passes the chat said N lines had failed while every price had changed on the
# first click (blastyw, 21 September, client 2.0.23). A line that has not
# changed yet is now looked at again every CHECK_EVERY seconds for up to
# PATIENCE before it is sent again.
#
# Python 2.7 as the client has it.
