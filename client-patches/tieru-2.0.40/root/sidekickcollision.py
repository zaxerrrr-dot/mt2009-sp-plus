# Walking through one's own companion (server 2.2.23; Tieru, 26 September:
# "towarzysz jest dla naszej postaci nieblokujacym, zeby dalo sie przez niego
# przenikac, bo jak expi sie z nim to on strasznie przeszkadza").
#
# The collision between two characters is the client's alone:
# CInstanceBase::CheckAdvancing tests the main instance against every other
# one, and CActorInstance::TestActorCollision skips a victim whose actor type
# is NPC (ENABLE_NPC_WITHOUT_COLLISIONS in this client's GameLib). The server
# tells the owner's client which character its companion is
# (playerbot_sidekick.h, SendPlayerBotSidekickBody):
#
#   SidekickVid <vid>     - 0 once it has gone
#
# and the keeper below types that instance as an NPC - chr.SetInstanceType on
# the selected instance - whenever the client has made it anew, which it does
# every time the companion comes back into view. Nothing else of the instance
# changes. What an NPC's type also means in this client: a click on the
# companion opens no player menu (its own window gives and takes items), a new
# hair or sash shows when it next comes into view, and the minimap draws it
# as an NPC.
#
# Python 2.7 as the client has it; any exe of this line has the three chr
# calls, and one without them only loses the collision, never the game.
