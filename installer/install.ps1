#  Metin2 server -- one-command installer for Windows.
#
#      irm https://example.com/install.ps1 | iex
#
#  ...or, to pass options:
#
#      iex "& { $(irm https://example.com/install.ps1) } -DryRun"
#
#  THIS INSTALLS A SERVER YOU CAN PLAY ON BY YOURSELF, ON THIS PC.
#
#  Every part of it is bound to 127.0.0.1 -- the address that means "this
#  computer and nothing else". No port is opened to your home network or to the
#  internet, no firewall rule is created, and nobody else can join, not even
#  someone sitting next to you on the same Wi-Fi. That is deliberate: putting a
#  game server on a home connection means handing out your home IP address, and
#  it is not what most people want when they say "I would like to try this".
#
#  If you want a real server that friends can play on, rent a small Linux VPS
#  and use install.sh instead. The last section of the output tells you how.
#
#  What it does, in order:
#
#     1. checks this PC can run it (processor, memory, disk, Windows version)
#     2. makes sure Docker Desktop is installed and running
#     3. downloads the server
#     4. invents a password for the admin panel and two for the database
#     5. builds and starts the server, all on 127.0.0.1
#     6. starts building a game client pointed at 127.0.0.1, and -- long after
#        this installer has finished -- unpacks it onto this PC and puts a
#        "Metin2 Singleplayer" shortcut on the Desktop
#     7. prints the three things you need: the game, panel link, password
#
#  Safe to run twice. If a server is already here it says so and leaves your
#  characters alone.
#
#  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Written so that a HALF-DOWNLOADED copy cannot do anything: everything is
#  inside functions and the only line that runs anything is the very last one.
#  A truncated download is a parse error, and PowerShell parses the whole thing
#  before running any of it -- so nothing happens at all.
#  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  PowerShell 5.1 compatible. It does not need PowerShell 7.

#  Where the server comes from.
#
#  There is no release archive, and there never will be one. The project holds
#  the Linux port and nothing else -- one 109 KB patch touching 28 files, plus
#  the scripts that turn a checkout into something buildable. Everything
#  copyrighted (the game source, the runtime data tree, the SQL dumps) belongs
#  to Ymir/Webzen and to whoever assembled the r40250 server-file package, and
#  it is not ours to hand out.
#
#  So the server is assembled here, on this PC:
#
#     1. get the project -- a git clone of a few megabytes -- unless a copy is
#        already on this PC
#     2. run linux-port/fetch-sources.sh, which obtains the original r40250
#        package, extracts the source, the game data and the SQL dumps, applies
#        the port, and fills in the Docker build context
#
#  That second script is POSIX shell, and Windows has no shell that can run it.
#  Rather than translate 43 KB of hard-won logic into PowerShell -- and get a
#  second set of bugs for free -- it is run inside a small Debian container, on
#  the Docker that this installer has already made sure is working. The Windows
#  install and the Linux install therefore run exactly the same code, which is
#  worth a great deal when somebody has to debug one of them from a distance.

# =============================================================================
#  Step 6 -- the game client, and getting it onto this PC
#
#  Built by a separate compose service that downloads a large archive, patches
#  the address the client connects to (127.0.0.1 here), repacks it and leaves
#  client.zip where the panel serves it. It takes a long time, so it runs in
#  the background and we report honestly on where it got to.
#
#  On a Windows install that download page is a round trip to nowhere: the
#  client is being built on the very PC that is going to play it. So the same
#  background run carries on afterwards -- it copies the finished zip out of
#  the panel's volume, unpacks it here, and puts a shortcut on the Desktop.
#  Nobody has to open a browser to get the game they just built.
#
#  All of that happens AFTER this installer has printed its summary and gone.
#  The build is twenty to sixty minutes and nobody will sit and watch it, so
#  the copy-out, the unpack and the shortcut cannot live in this script's own
#  flow. They live in a small script written next to the server --
#  client-setup.ps1 -- which this one starts detached and then forgets about.
#  It is an ordinary file you can read, and running it again by hand is the
#  supported way to retry: it does nothing at all when the game is already
#  here.
#
#  WHERE THE GAME LANDS: <install dir>\client. Three reasons for that rather
#  than the Desktop or a temp folder:
#
#    * the install folder's length has already been measured against Windows'
#      260-character limit (Test-InstallPathLength); the Desktop's has not,
#      and the client tree is three levels deep with long pack names in it
#    * on a great many PCs the Desktop is redirected into OneDrive, and
#      unpacking 1.2 GB there would quietly begin uploading it to the cloud
#    * everything this installer made then sits in one folder, so "delete the
#      folder" stays the whole uninstall
#
#  It costs about 1.2 GB for the copied zip -- deleted the moment it is
#  unpacked -- and roughly twice that for the unpacked tree, both on the
#  install folder's drive. The obvious way to avoid the copy, bind-mounting a
#  Windows folder into the builder so it writes straight there, is much worse:
#  a gigabyte of small files through Docker Desktop's filesystem bridge takes
#  far longer than copying one finished archive out afterwards.

  Where the server comes from:

    -ReferenceDir DIR  an already-unpacked "[40250] Reference Serverfile"
                       folder (the one with Server\ in it). Nothing is
                       downloaded when you give this.
    -Archive PATH      the server-file package as you downloaded it -- the
                       .zip/.rar/.7z, or metin2_server+src.tar.gz
    -ClientArchive PATH
                       a compatible native Windows client archive to configure
                       locally (not included or downloaded by this project)
    -RepoDir PATH      use this checkout of the project instead of cloning one
    -RepoUrl URL       clone the project from here
    -LocalContext DIR  skip all of the above: install from a Docker build
                       context that is already prepared
