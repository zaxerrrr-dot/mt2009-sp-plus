#  Metin2 server -- one-command installer for Linux.
#
#      curl -fsSL https://example.com/install.sh | sh
#
#  ...or, if you want to answer no questions:
#
#      curl -fsSL https://example.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --yes
#
#  This assumes you are on a SERVER and that you want other people to be able
#  to connect and play. It publishes the game ports on every network interface
#  and opens the firewall for them. If you want a private server that only you
#  can reach -- on your own PC -- use the Windows installer instead, or pass
#  --local here.
#
#  What it does, in order:
#
#     1. checks the machine can actually run this (CPU type, memory, disk)
#     2. installs Docker if it is not already there
#     3. assembles the server: fetches the upstream server-file package,
#        applies the Linux port to it and builds the Docker context
#     4. invents a password for the admin panel and two for the database
#     5. builds and starts the server
#     6. opens the firewall
#     7. sets up HTTPS, if you gave it a domain name
#     8. starts building the game client for your players to download
#     9. prints the three things you need: client link, panel link, password
#
#  It is safe to run twice. If a server is already installed it says so and
#  offers to leave your accounts and characters alone.
#
#  Every secret is generated on this machine, at the moment you run this.
#  Nothing is baked in, and nothing is sent anywhere.
#
#  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This script is deliberately written so that a HALF-DOWNLOADED copy cannot
#  do anything: everything lives inside a shell function, and the only line
#  that actually runs anything is the very last one. If the download is cut
#  short the shell hits a parse error and stops, having changed nothing.

#  Where the server comes from.
#
#  There is no release archive, and there never will be one. The repository
#  holds the Linux port and nothing else -- one 109 KB patch touching 28 files,
#  plus the scripts that turn a checkout into something buildable. Everything
#  copyrighted (the game source, the runtime data tree, the SQL dumps) belongs
#  to Ymir/Webzen and to whoever assembled the r40250 server-file package, and
#  it is not ours to redistribute.
#
#  So the server is assembled here, on this machine, in two moves:
#
#     1. get the repository -- a git clone of a few megabytes -- unless a
#        checkout is already on this machine
#     2. run linux-port/fetch-sources.sh with an operator-supplied r40250
#        archive/reference directory. It extracts the source, share/ data tree
#        and SQL dumps, applies the port, and fills the Docker build context
#
#  Override any of it:

# a database backup, and `rm -rf /opt/metin2' a few steps later. Run the
# installer from that same shell and it starts in a directory that no longer
# has a path.
#
# Nothing looks wrong. Linux keeps the directory's inode alive for as long as a
# process stands in it, so `pwd' prints the old name out of the shell's own
# cache and even `[ -d . ]' succeeds -- both were measured doing exactly that.
# Only getcwd() fails, and the first symptom used to be git giving up three
# minutes into the run with "Unable to read current working directory", which
# reads like a network fault and is not one.
#
# `pwd -P' is the portable way to put the question to getcwd() directly, but it
# has to be asked by its OUTPUT and not by its exit status. Measured in all
# three shells with the directory gone: dash and sh print the error and still
# exit 0; only bash exits 1. Stdout is empty in every one of them, whether this
# shell deleted the directory itself or inherited it from the one that did.
# `cd .' is no good either -- it fails in sh and dash but succeeds in bash --
# and `[ -d . ]' succeeds everywhere, because the inode outlives the name for
# as long as a process stands in it.
#
# Nothing here needs the starting directory: every path is absolute by the time
# it is used. So moving to / costs nothing and rescues the run.

#
#      desktop   Reference_Client.zip, 1.29 GB, built into a download for the
#                panel's button. What every Metin2 server has always offered.
#      browser   Reference_WebClientEngine.zip (17.6 MB) + Reference_
#                WebClientData.zip (1.75 GB). No download, no install: a link.
#
#  A server that offers only one must not pay for the other -- choosing the
#  desktop client alone should not drag in 1.75 GB nobody will ever read. That
#  is the whole reason these are separate archives.
#
#  On an update nothing is asked when both are already there: this runs
#  unattended for some people and a question would hang it forever. When one is
#  missing it is offered, because that is the only moment the operator finds out
#  the other way exists.

    # The fetcher's script and pointer file have to sit beside docker-compose.yml,
    # because a bind mount can only name a path inside the directory compose was
    # given. fetch_stack() copies them there -- but it has several paths that
    # return before the copy, and an install that is already at the published
    # version takes one of them. So make sure here, every run: this is also what
    # repairs a server that updated while the copy was missing.
    # A checkout is not always around when this runs: the path that skips
    # restaging -- an install already at the published version -- never calls
    # locate_repo, so REPO_DIR is empty exactly on the servers that update
    # first. Downloading is therefore not a fallback but the normal case, and
    # the checkout is preferred only when there is one.
    # REFRESHED EVERY RUN, NOT PLACED ONCE.
    #
    # This used to skip a file that was already there, and that quietly made
    # browser-client updates impossible: artifacts.json IS the pointer that says
    # which engine version an install should have, so a stale copy reports that
    # the installed engine is current and the fetcher correctly does nothing.
    # MEASURED -- a server ran the 1.11.3 installer to completion, reported
    # success, and kept engine 1.11.0, because the pointer it consulted was the
    # one that shipped with 1.11.0.
    #

    # so an update with no network to GitHub degrades to "keep what you have"
