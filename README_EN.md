A local Metin2 singleplayer world populated by genuine, autonomous player characters (Playerbots): leveling up, grinding solo and in squads, looting items, refining gear at the Blacksmith, hunting Metin stones, and persisting their full progression in the standard database.

## 💬 Community & Project Support

Every contribution — testing, bug reports, ideas, code, or financial support — helps us build a more autonomous and lively Metin2 world.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project supports the **native Windows client only**. It neither contains nor automatically downloads Metin2 files, the r40250 package, or the withdrawn upstream WebClient. Installation requires your own compatible files. See [project provenance and attribution](docs/ATTRIBUTION.md).

Unlike conventional external client-bot scripts, bots in this project are **first-class PC entities controlled by AI logic embedded directly inside the game core server engine**. Real players connecting to the server observe their natural movement, combat combos, skill casts, and equipment via standard Metin2 network packets.

## 🌟 Bot Capabilities

- ⚔️ **Smart Combat Engine**: Full support for all character classes (Warrior, Sura BM/WP, Ninja Dagger/Archer, Shaman), smooth combo animations, projectile-based bow attacks consuming arrows, active buff maintenance, and skill rotations.
- 🗺️ **Global 2D NavGrid (A*)**: High-resolution collision grid generated from engine map attributes (`server_attr`) coupled with Global A* and String-Pulling line-of-sight trajectory smoothing.
- 🚪 **Multi-map Travel**: Autonomous crossings M1 ↔ M2 ↔ M3, the Easy Monkey Dungeon, Orc Valley, the Yongbi Desert, Mount Sohan and the Spider Dungeon V1. Bots pick the map by level and the hub on it by the population's shared memory of where the monsters stand.
- 🏹 **Hunting missions to level 55 and the Orc Tooth**: the official `levelup` missions taken without a dialog, the option chosen for the map the bot is on; seven Biologist missions including the Orc Tooth and the Soul Stone.
- 🎁 **Chests and bosses**: Moonlight Treasure Chests and boss caskets are opened and their contents used (bonus scrolls, speed potions, the Blessing Scroll for refines from +6). Parties, guild mates first, raid the Orc Chief and the Spider Queen.
- 💎 **Metin Stone Hunting**: Dedicated roving Metin hunters patrolling the map, shattering stones, and clearing spawned add waves.
- 🎒 **Looting & Town Economy**: Post-battle loot collection, automated equipment evaluation including shields, appropriate merchant visits, potion restocking, and gear refinement at the **Blacksmith**.
- 🐴 **Horse Progression**: Real Horse Medal expeditions into the Monkey Dungeon, delivery to the nearest Stable Boy, and mounted long-distance travel.
- 👥 **Party & Squad Dynamics**: Dynamic 2–3 player squads, and up to 8 in Orc Valley for the Black Orc camps; cooperative exping and pulling mobs in dense monster camps.
- 🏪 **Stalls and a bot-to-bot market**: Bots open private stalls in Bokjung and **buy from each other** — the refine material someone is short of, or a piece of gear better than what they are wearing. Anything at +7 or above is never sold to an NPC merchant.
- 🧬 **Biologist missions**: Collecting specimens and handing them in stage by stage, driven without a quest dialog.
- 🎣 **Fishing**: A full session — bait written into the rod's socket, waiting for the bite, and pulling inside the six-second window.
- ✨ **Bonus rerolling**: Bots use Change and Add Attribute stones on gear they are not currently wearing.
- 🧠 **Personality and goals**: Every bot has its own character and ambition (Metin hunter, collector, horse breeder, a "dropper" of Metins, M3, M2 or medals) that decides what it does with a given hour.
- 🎛️ **The panel steers behaviour live**: goal weight sliders, a switch for the bots' overhead chat, scrap keepers selling cheap fodder for the blacksmith, and the Moonlight chest chance — all read by the core within five seconds, no restart.
- 💾 **Native MariaDB Persistence**: Each bot has its own persistent account and character entry in MariaDB, retaining Level, EXP, Yang, items, and quest flags across server restarts.

## 📊 Project Status

The project is under active research and development.

> [!NOTE]
> **Supported Kingdoms:** The autonomous world covers **all three kingdoms** (**Chunjo** – Yellows, **Shinsoo** – Reds, and **Jinno** – Blues) including M1, M2, M3, Monkey Dungeons, **Orc Valley**, **Yongbi Desert**, **Mount Sohan**, **Hwang Temple**, and **Spider Dungeons**!

### Resource Footprint (measured with 843 bots alive)
- **Game Engine (`game core`)**: ~1.8 GiB RAM, ~25–38% of one core (a route planner on its own grid, with a memory of planned routes)
- **Database (`MariaDB`)**: ~89 MiB RAM
- **Web Admin Panel & Live Map**: ~270 MiB RAM
- Runs smoothly in the background on standard modern developer PCs.
- `PLAYERBOT_AUTOSPAWN_COUNT` asks for a number, but the ceiling is how many canonical identities exist in the database (`BOT_COUNT` in `generate_seed.py`), not the slider.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Prepare the files

Have a compatible local r40250 server archive ready. A native Windows client archive, preferably from the exact same release, is optional if you already have a configured client. The “r40250” label alone does not guarantee matching packets and proto files. Neither file belongs in this repository.

### 2. Clone and Install (Windows)
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/TieruYT/metin2-playerbots.git
Set-Location .\metin2-playerbots
& .\installer\install.ps1 `
    -Archive 'C:\path\Reference_Server.zip' `
    -ClientArchive 'C:\path\Reference_Client.zip' `
    -NoWebClient
```

If you already have a configured client, replace `-ClientArchive` with `-NoClient`.

### 3. Start the Server after installation
```powershell
Set-Location "$env:USERPROFILE\Metin2Server"
docker compose up -d
```

After the start two web panels are running: the classic admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:7788` and the **Metin2 Singleplayer Panel** by seban latino at `http://127.0.0.1:7790` — a live map of the bot world, character profiles with inventories and item tooltips, rankings, economy history, host telemetry, live bot controls and bulk item grants. The first visit to `/setup` asks for a name, a theme and an optional password.

### 4. Join the Game
Point the client from the same compatible r40250 set to `127.0.0.1` (Auth port `11000`, Game ports `13000–13002`) and jump into the living world in Joan (Chunjo)!

## 🎮 In-Game Commands (GM Commands)

Manage bots directly via in-game chat (requires GM / Administrator permissions):

| Command | Permission | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/bot_spawn <id> <empire: 1-3>` | GM | Spawns a specific bot by Player ID into the designated empire (`1` = Shinsoo, `2` = Chunjo, `3` = Jinno). | `/bot_spawn 4 2` |
| `/bot_despawn <id>` | GM | Despawns and logs out a specific bot. | `/bot_despawn 4` |
| `/bot_spawn_many <start_id> <count> <empire>` | GM | Spawns a batch range of bots into the designated empire. | `/bot_spawn_many 4 350 2` |
| `/bot_despawn_many <start_id> <count>` | GM | Despawns a batch range of bots starting from `start_id`. | `/bot_despawn_many 4 350` |
| `/bot_rank` | All Players | Prints the top level leaderboard and bot coordinates in chat. | `/bot_rank` |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1**: Full combat animations for all classes, Archer projectiles, 2D NavGrid (A*), Blacksmith refinement cycle, and 32 regional hubs in Chunjo.
- [x] **Phase 2A**: M1/M2/M3 traversal, level-based zones, the Easy Monkey Dungeon, and real Horse Medal expeditions.
- [ ] **Phase 2B**: Orc Valley ✅ and Yongbi Desert ✅ — full **Demon Tower (DT)** runs still to come.
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Reading Skill Books (KU) and Soul Stones (KD), advanced skill priority trees.
- [x] **Phase 4A**: Early Biologist missions and first-stage horse progression backed by real Horse Medal drops.
- [x] **Phase 4B**: the Orc Tooth and the Soul Stone at the Biologist (with the quest's own chance of a spoiled tooth), hunting missions to level 55, the battle horse from the desert trial.
- [ ] **Phase 4C** *(up next)*: later Biologist missions, three kingdoms and kingdom wars.
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Fishing ✅ — mining ore veins and alchemy crafting still to come.
- [x] **Phase 6**: Private bot stalls in town and bot-to-bot trading. Pricing is still fixed-tier rather than demand-driven.
