"""MT2009_PLUS_DB_EDITOR_V1: "Edytor bazy danych" - the database editor of the
Seban panel, for an operator who is not a programmer: items, skills, monster
drops (with their groups) and chests, plus the client data the game's clients
download after a change.

Each part is a module of this package with an install(bp, ctx) function that
adds its routes to the one blueprint (url prefix /db). ctx carries the panel's
helpers (db, rows, one, login_required, game_text, ...), so no module imports
app.py. The hub page lists the parts that are installed.
