# The market of Shinsoo's and Jinno's villages moved onto the kingdom's guard
# in 2.0.52 (GetTownPitch, playerbot_empire_rules.h), and nothing would ever
# have moved the shops standing round the old pitch: an offline shop stands
# where its keeper stood when it was opened (OpenOfflineShop takes the
# character's position, a reopen included) and a keeper walks to its shop to
# serve it. So each bot's shop of the old ring is carried across by the
# distance between the two pitches, which keeps the ring's shape and spacing,
# and pulled in to 1650 of the guard where it stood further out - the ring of
# 400 to 1700 round each guard is open ground inside the safe zone on
# server_attr. A shop already inside the new ring and outside the old one
# belongs to the new pitch and stays. Once, marked in
# player.playerbot_migrations in the same transaction as the move; on every
# start after that only a bot's shop still within 2000 of an old pitch and more
# than 2000 from the new one moves - a keeper that reopened on the old spot
# while an update ran this beside the old game container (update.sh does not
# stop the game first). The db core writes a position only when a shop is
# opened or moved, so an old core cannot write the moved ones back. A player's
# own shop is left where its owner put it. Before the game container starts,
