-- Four game masters on the tester account, one per class, fully equipped.
--
-- The mt2009 package ships an empty gmlist and no character on `admin'.
-- This file creates Admin (warrior), AdminNinja, AdminSura and AdminSzaman
-- at level ninety, each with IMPLEMENTOR rights, the best +9 set the
-- CLIENT can show for its class with strong bonus lines, a second weapon,
-- a bag of potions and scrolls, the Oil of Banishment (71054, changes the
-- kingdom), and a level-21 horse with its summon book (50053, what the
-- stable keeper hands out for a grade-3 horse).
--
-- "The best the client can show" is not "the best item_proto has": the
-- server's proto goes to level 90 (Pancerz Diabelskiego Rogu, shape 13;
-- Zbroja z Niebieskiej Stali, shape 26) and to level-87 weapons (Runiczny
-- Miecz 460...), but the client's pc2/*.msm know shapes 0-12, 14-22 and 24
-- only and its item pack carries weapon models up to the level-75 set
-- (00180, 00190, 01130, 02170, 03160, 05120, 07180). A character in an
-- armour the client cannot draw is invisible and cannot move (Iwakura,
-- 11 September, on 2.0.4's set). So: the level-66 "black" armour (shape 12)
-- and the level-75 weapons, and the repair block at the end swaps them in
-- on a world that already has the four with the old set.
--
-- Runs on a fresh world from initdb.d (10-import-dumps.sh) and on every
-- start from apply.sh. Until 2.0.8 it did nothing unless the admin account
-- had no character at all, so the operator who had made his own character
-- on it before the four existed never got them ("na moim koncie admin nie
-- ma postaci GM, tylko moja Tieru"). Now it fills the account's free slots
-- (an account holds four characters) with the classes the account does
-- not have yet, in the order above; a class somebody already plays there
-- is skipped, and an account with four characters gets nothing. Whatever
-- is already on the account is left exactly as it is. PIDs 9001-9004: the
-- playerbot seed uses 4..2503 with explicit ids, and player.player's
-- AUTO_INCREMENT would have handed a fresh world 1..4 and collided with
-- the seed's pid 4.
--
-- The new characters stand in their kingdom's first village - the market
-- pitch of playerbot_empire_rules.h (Joan for Chunjo, Yongan for Shinsoo,
-- Pyongmoo for Jinno) - because player_index carries one empire for the
-- whole account and a character in the wrong kingdom's town is stuck there.
--
-- Columns of player.player as playerbots_seed.sql writes them; the rest
-- takes the table's defaults. Bonus lines are POINT numbers (common/length.h):
-- this engine stores POINT ids in item.attrtype, not APPLY ids. Slots 5 and
-- 6 of a weapon carry the two damage lines (122 average, 121 skill) the way
-- item_addon.cpp writes them.
