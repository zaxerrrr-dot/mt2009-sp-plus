#
# waitress does not pass X-Forwarded-* through. Its clear_untrusted_proxy_headers
# is on by default, so unless it is told which proxy to trust it DELETES those
# headers before the application runs -- and the application's own careful
# handling of them, which checks that they came from nginx before believing a
# word, therefore never saw one. Nothing reported it. The panel simply behaved
# as though every visitor had reached it directly: it handed the browser client
# the bridge's own port over plain ws:// on an HTTPS page, which browsers block,
# and it sent the gigabyte client download through Python instead of handing it
# to nginx.
#
# Told to trust the proxy, waitress does the opposite: it APPLIES the headers to
# the scheme, the host and the client address, and removes them afterwards. So
# the app cannot tell from the request either way, and reads M2PANEL_TRUST_PROXY
# instead -- see behind_proxy() in admin_panel.py.
#
# Trusting every source is safe here and only here: the installer sets this in
# the arm that also publishes the panel on 127.0.0.1 alone, so nothing but nginx
# can open a connection to it. M2_PANEL_TRUSTED_PROXY narrows it to one address
# for anyone who arranges things differently.
# Built as positional parameters rather than as a string, because the default
