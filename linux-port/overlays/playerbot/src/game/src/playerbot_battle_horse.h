// Earning the battle horse.
//
// The stable keeper's own quest (horse_upgrade) is the reference and most of it
// is kept: character level 35, a horse already at the cap of 10, a hundred kills
// out in the desert, five hundred thousand yang at the end, and the armoured
// horse book handed over while the ordinary horse's paper is taken away.
//
// Three things in it could not be kept, and each is a fact about this world
// rather than a preference:
//
//   * The quest gives thirty minutes and fails you at the end of them. A bot
//     hunts in a straight line for hours and has nobody to be disappointed by a
//     failure, so there is no clock: it kills until it is done.
//   * The quest then makes you wait eight to sixteen hours for the horse to be
//     made ready. That wait exists to slow a person down between play sessions;
//     for a population that never logs off it is only a pause in a log file.
//
// The medal item the quest consumes to begin, and the horse photograph it
// consumes at the end, are not required. There is one medal in this entire
// world and not a single photograph, and no path by which a bot could ever get
// one - requiring them would mean shipping a system that can never run.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: include
// it exactly once, before playerbot_activities.h - the stable visit hands the
// horse over - and before playerbot_travel.h, which has to send a bot on the
// trial to the desert whatever its level says.
