// A person's guild answering for the person, as pure policy.
//
// A bot a person strikes has had its guild answer since Iwakura's Community
// Patch 2, point 15 (playerbot_anti_pk.h, BOT_FOE_GUILD): every bot of the
// guild within twelve kilometres goes for the person. The other side of the
// same fight had nothing: "W przypadku walki z botem z innego krolestwa na
// jakiejs mapie zlatuja sie boty z jego gildii by walczyc z nami, ale boty z
// naszej gildii kompletnie to olewaja (dwukrotnie pobliski bot z mojej gildii
// olal sytuacje, ze walcze z 5 innymi botami)" (Derpsonkowy95, 28 September;
// Iwakura: "Punkt 1 jest spoko, mozna dodac"; Tieru: "jestem na tak"). People
// invite bots into their guilds, and those bots now answer for the person the
// way a bot guild answers for its bot - bounded where that one is not:
//
// - against bots only, of another kingdom and another guild than the
//   person's. A bot of the person's own kingdom fights the person only after
//   the person's own blow in free mode, which is the Anti-PK protocol's to
//   answer, and a person striking the person is the people's own quarrel: this
//   answer never turns a bot on a person;
// - never for a person under a truce (playerbot_truce_rules.h): a person who
//   has made peace with the bots has no fight for its guild to take up;
// - by the guild's bots near the person, one for each bot fighting it and
//   never more than a cap - even sides, as the wars have been since 2.2.26;
// - for as long as the fight lasts: an attacker is in it while its last blow
//   at the person is recent or while it still holds the person as its foe,
//   and a defender lets go the moment its attacker is not, the person is down
//   or gone, or the person has made peace.
//
// Who may answer is asked in the order of what outranks the answer (WhyNot):
// a raid, a war, a duel, a companion's owner, another person's claim on the
// bot, the errands that hold engine state (a town visit, a stall, an open
// trade or safebox), and then the bot itself - away from the keyboard,
// standing up after a death, hurt, too far.
//
// No engine types: pids, VIDs, empires, guild ids and the clock come in as
// numbers. The engine side is playerbot_anti_pk.h. Tested in
// tests/playerbot_guild_aid_rules_test.cpp.
