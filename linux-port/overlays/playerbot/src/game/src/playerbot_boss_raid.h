// Boss raids: a world boss broken by a crowd of one kingdom.
//
// A boss used to be a place to walk to (the boss hubs of
// playerbot_wandering.h), and three things kept him standing. A monster one
// bot had picked was nobody else's target (IsTargetClaimedByAnotherBot), so
// whoever came second chained onto his escort instead. The rule that gives
// up a fight going nowhere gave up a boss that heals faster than one bot
// hurts him - the Spider Queen takes back a tenth of her health every ten
// seconds, the Yellow Tiger Spectre an eighth every seven - and put him on
// the failed list for two minutes. And the walk to a boss hub was chosen only
// on a tick with nothing else to hit, and dropped for the first monster on
// the way. Measured on the test world over two and a half days (25
// September): the Orc Chief killed once, in fifty-three minutes, by
// twenty-three bots of whom exactly one was on him for eighteen of the
// thirty-four minutes he was fought, and not one casket in any bag
// ("sprawdzilem stan szkatulek - nie ma u mnie ani jednej po paru dniach
// gry", prodnathin; Tieru: the Giant Turtle, the Flame King, the Spider
// Queen, Nine Tails, the Tiger Spectre - every boss has to be killed).
//
// A raid is the Demon Tower's shape on open ground. This core's world pass
// looks for every boss of PLAYERBOT_WORLD_BOSSES on the maps it hosts and
// calls a raid to one standing with none: up to bSize bots of one kingdom in
// his level window, the ones already on his map first and then the
// strongest, a Shaman among them when the kingdom has one free. Each called
// bot's tick is this pass's: it comes to its own spot outside his sight,
// buffs, and when enough have come - or he has started on one of them - they
// all go at him with the tower's fight and the tower's keeping alive. A boss
// who has not lost half a percent of his health in
// PLAYERBOT_BOSS_RAID_STALL_MS gets a few more bots once, and after the
// second such minute is given up for PLAYERBOT_BOSS_RAID_OUTPACED_COOLDOWN_MS.
// After his fall the loot pass has its window and the raid disbands.
//
// Not a party: a party's rules (the cohort, the straggler radius, the level
// gap of six) are about camps, and a raid of eight from four maps would be
// broken up by them before it met. The engine pays experience by damage and
// the drop to the best damager, which is what a crowd wants anyway.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes:
// include it once, after playerbot_demon_tower.h, whose fight it borrows.
