// The player's own companion - "Towarzysz" (Tieru, 24 September): a bot that
// belongs to one player for good, the way a follower does in Diablo. The
// player picks its class, its sex, its path and its name in the Towarzysz
// quest; from then on it is in the player's party with the experience split
// evenly, walks at the player's side, fights what the player fights and what
// attacks the player, buffs the player, picks the player's drops up into the
// player's own bag, accepts every trade the player offers, and refines and
// shops when the player stands at the blacksmith or a merchant. It logs in and
// out with the player. "Wolna reka" lets it play like any other bot while the
// player is online; "Przywolaj" puts it back at the player's side. "Gra beze
// mnie", off unless the player sets it in the window, keeps it in the world
// when the player leaves the game, playing like any other bot and earning
// experience up to thirty levels over the player's. It never takes a duel,
// and nobody's duel is its fight.
//
// A companion is an ordinary registered bot identity - a seeded
// playerbot_NNN account, with every guard LoadRegisteredBots keeps - picked
// from the player's kingdom by the race asked for, renamed, raised to the
// player's level at its first spawn, and written into
// player.playerbot_sidekick. Nothing of the population's machinery may start,
// move or log out such an identity (CPlayerBotManager::Spawn refuses it
// unless SpawnSidekick asks, the top-up, the late joiners, the life schedule
// and the channel coordinator step over it): whether it is in the world is its
// owner's presence on this core alone.
//
// A player who fights a player is defended by the Anti-PK protocol, which
// already answers for a person in a party with bots in it
// (playerbot_anti_pk.h, BOT_FOE_PARTY) and runs above this pass in the tick.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: include
// it exactly once, after playerbot_demon_tower.h (the fight is that file's)
// and before playerbot_companions.h, whose IsPlayerBotHeldForCompany asks it.

	// swojemu towarzyszowi buffy jak sie skoncza i znowu wejsc i bic" (the
	// owner, 5 October). From a battle horse or a seal's mount that is not a
	// standing one it breaks a Metin with the swing alone
	// (CanPlayerBotFightOnHorse) - no skill of a class is cast from that
	// saddle - and the buffs came down one at a time: the owner's pass
	// (ManagePlayerBotBuffPerson) climbed down for one the owner had already
	// lost and renewed nothing that was about to go, the companion's own pass
	// (ManagePlayerBotCombatBuffs) climbed down for its own copy two seconds
	// later, once the skill had cooled from the owner's cast, and a buff
	// running out a moment after the saddle took it back took it down again.
	//
	// So once a second it looks from the saddle: a buff of its path gone or
	// with PLAYERBOT_SIDEKICK_REBUFF_DUE_SECONDS left on the owner (in the
	// skill's reach, its "buffy" on) or on itself, off its cooldown and paid
	// for, takes it down - with no mana for it, a blue potion first and the
	// saddle kept. On foot it puts up everything of the owner's and its own
	// with PLAYERBOT_SADDLE_BUFF_REFRESH_SECONDS or less left, one cast a pass,
	// waits out a cooldown of PLAYERBOT_SIDEKICK_REBUFF_COOL_WAIT_MS (the
	// owner's copy and its own are one skill), and with nothing left lets the
	// fight put it back in the saddle at once (FightPlayerBotTowerObjective).
	// Then PLAYERBOT_SIDEKICK_REBUFF_GAP_MS before it looks again, and a cast
	// the engine refused is left alone for PLAYERBOT_SIDEKICK_REBUFF_FAIL_MS,
	// so no buff takes it up and down in a loop. An owner out of the skill's
	// reach is not waited for: its own buffs only, the owner's when it is
	// back in reach. Its own Swiftness is a walking buff, which the horse
