// The player's own companion - "Towarzysz" (Tieru, 24 September): a bot that
// belongs to one player for good, the way a follower does in Diablo. The
// player picks its class, its sex, its path and its name in the Towarzysz
// quest; from then on it is in the player's party with the experience split
// evenly, walks at the player's side, fights what the player fights and what
// attacks the player, buffs the player, picks the player's drops up into the
// player's own bag, accepts every trade the player offers, and refines and
// shops when the player stands at the blacksmith or a merchant. It logs in and
// out with the player. "Wolna reka" lets it play like any other bot while the
// player is online; "Przywolaj" puts it back at the player's side. It never
// takes a duel, and nobody's duel is its fight.
//
// A companion is an ordinary registered bot identity - a seeded
// playerbot_NNN account, with every guard LoadRegisteredBots keeps - picked
// from the player's kingdom by the race asked for, renamed, raised to the
// player's level at its first spawn, and written into
// player.playerbot_sidekick. Nothing of the population's machinery may start,
// move or log out such an identity (CPlayerBotManager::Spawn refuses it
// unless SpawnSidekick asks, the top-up, the late joiners, the life schedule
// and the channel coordinator step over it): whether it is in the world is its
// owner's presence on this core alone.
//
// A player who fights a player is defended by the Anti-PK protocol, which
// already answers for a person in a party with bots in it
// (playerbot_anti_pk.h, BOT_FOE_PARTY) and runs above this pass in the tick.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: include
// it exactly once, after playerbot_demon_tower.h (the fight is that file's)
// and before playerbot_companions.h, whose IsPlayerBotHeldForCompany asks it.
