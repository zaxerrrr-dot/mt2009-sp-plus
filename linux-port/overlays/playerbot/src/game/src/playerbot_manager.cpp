	// Spreading the visitors of a Monkey Dungeon over its rooms on the way in.

	// 108, 16 of 256 on 109, 16 of 231 on 25 - and nearly every visiting bot,
	// because a visit is spent there: a bot leaves the moment its medal drops,
	// a median of 41 s, and the wander pass that chooses a door only runs on a
	// tick with nothing to hit. Every monkey of a dungeon carries the medal's
	// kill group, so the odds do not depend on the room. What the pile cost was
	// monsters - roughly fifteen times fewer per bot than the dungeon holds -
	// and the "whole dungeon in one line" players reported.
	//
	// So a bot in its first room of a visit rolls, by pid and weighted by how
	// many spawns each room holds, whether to stay or which door to take, and
	// walks there before it hunts. It yields to anything actually hitting it -
	// the walk is no reason to be killed - and to its own retreat, and resumes
	// when that is over. One door only: a second would meet the engine's door
	// block and the AI's own dwell, which are what keep a bot from being bounced
	// back, and past the first room the ordinary rotation carries it on. A bot
	// the engine has just moved through a door is not sent to another: it would
	// only stand there.
	//
	// The walk has a budget, and the budget is the walking. The entrance room is
	// a long corridor of aggressive monkeys: the first version gave the walk
	// forty seconds of wall time, and of the first six walks two crossed - both
	// at thirty-eight seconds - while the four that gave up had been going the
	// right way and stopping for whatever caught them, one of them fighting for
	// all forty. The time a fight holds the walk up does not count against it,

// The two channels with moves (playerbot_channel_rules.h).
//
// SIZOWSKI's design and most of his code (metin2-ch2-dual-channel, sent on 18
// September and run on his world of 1500 bots since), fitted to this world's
// switch and slider: with the second channel on, a bot's channel is its row
// of common.playerbot_channel_assignment - one row a pid, so one channel a
// pid - and a bot on the second channel with business at a shop asks to be
// moved to the shop channel (RequestShopChannel). The coordinator runs on the
// shop channel's core that hosts Joan: every five seconds a census of the
// bots that play and of who waits, and at most once a gate a step - waiting
// bots straight in while the shop channel is under its cap, one for one
// against free bots of the shop channel at the cap (and a few more out than
// in over it), and with nobody waiting the shop channel eased back to its
// target. Nothing moves until both channels have started their bots. What the operator's slider says
// is the cap and the target (ShopChannelCapPercent), so the slider's 40 is
// his 60 and 50.
//
// A move is a row changed and nothing else. The old core reads the change
// within a refresh and logs the bot out (Despawn saves it like any logout);
// the new one spawns it once the row's ready time has passed - and Spawn's
// P2P test refuses it while the old core still holds it - so the bot is never
// on two cores at once. That was the whole objection to his first patch,
// which swapped bots through the database without a ready time.
//
// Every statement runs on m_pChannelSql, a connection and thread of this
// manager's own: the game thread queues a statement and collects the answer
// on a later tick, and never waits for the database.
