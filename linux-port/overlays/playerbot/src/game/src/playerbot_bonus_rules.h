// Which stone a bot puts on which piece next - the add stone, the Blessing
// Marble's fifth line, the change stone, a green one or an ordinary one - as
// pure policy. No engine types; unit-tested in
// tests/playerbot_bonus_rules_test.cpp. playerbot_bonus.h is the engine's half:
// it reads the pieces, the bag and the gates, asks here, and spends the stone
// the answer names.
//
// Two points of Iwakura's Community Patch 5 are this file.
//
// Point 5: a bot whose necklace, boots and bracelet were done kept seventeen
// adds and nine changes in its bag for good. The categories of Patch 4, point
// 6 (IsPlayerBotBonusCategoryAllowed) take the armour, the helmet, the shield
// and the earrings only at +7 and a weapon only at forty-five and +7, while
// the refine aim keeps the helmet and the jewellery at +4 until the weapon,
// the armour and the shield stand at +7 - and those three stall at +6 for want
// of scrolls. So the categories still come first, and what they cannot use
// now goes on to the rest of the worn gear (PLAIN_REST, RestOpen): "po
// wybonowaniu jednych przedmiotow bot powinien automatycznie przechodzic do
// kolejnych, az do calkowitego wybonowania ekwipunku".
//
// Point 9: Zielona Sila and Zielony Czar go on a weapon or a body armour of
// level forty or less and on nothing else (char_item.cpp), and the same
// categories refused every such weapon but the level-30 family and every such
// armour under +7, the weapon under forty-five waited for two health lines on
// the jewellery that only an ordinary stone can give, and the change stone
// waited for a fourth line three green adds cannot give. They are spent first
// now, on the armour and then on the weapon ("w pierwszej kolejnosci ... w
// zbroi, a nastepnie w broni"), and a Zielony Czar mixes whatever lines are
// there once no add stone can give the piece another ("mieszac bonusy dodane
// nie tylko za pomoca Zielonej Sily, ale takze inne bonusy dodatkowe").
