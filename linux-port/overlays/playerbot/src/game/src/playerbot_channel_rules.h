// The second channel as pure policy: which channel a registered bot lives on,
// and how much of the operator's number each channel starts. No engine types,
// unit-tested (tests/playerbot_channel_rules_test.cpp).
//
// A bot must live on exactly one channel. Every core loads the registry for
// itself and nothing tells one channel what another decided, so the answer has
// to come out the same on every core from the same inputs: the pid, the switch
// and the share from the container's environment, and whether the bot is
// pinned. Two cores that disagreed about one pid would both log it in - the
// db core serves a bot's load to anyone who asks, P2P_MANAGER overwrites its
// entry without a word, and the two copies' saves would duplicate every item
// either of them sold ("a same pid on two cores", read in the engine on 18
// September before any of this was written).
//
// A pinned bot is one that has kept an offline shop. Shops are the first
// channel's alone (the operator's rule: "wszystkie sklepy tylko na ch1"), a
// shop's entity stands on the channel it was opened on, and a keeper on the
// other channel could never serve its counter or take its yang out again - so
// every bot that has ever owned a shop lives on the first channel for good.
// The pins only grow (player.playerbot_channel_pin), which is what keeps the
// answer the same on a core restarted in the middle of a session: nobody on
// the second channel can open a shop, so no second-channel bot can become
// pinned while the other channel's cores are running.
//
// Only the channels the container switches on for bots carry them
// (M2_PLAYERBOT_CHANNELS, 1..4, MT2009_PLUS_CH34_V1 below); a channel started
// past those (M2_CHANNELS by hand) is players'.

	// from - asks to be moved to the shop channel, and the coordinator (the

	// shop channel is under its cap, one for one against a free bot of the
	// shop channel at the cap, and when nobody waits it eases the shop
	// channel back to its target. A move is a row changed and nothing else:
