// The Moonlight chest (Szkatulka Blasku Ksiezyca, 50011) and the bonus items
// that come out of it, as pure policy: which bot keeps a chest closed for its
// counter, what a chest is worth by what it holds, the floor no markdown takes
// a chest or a bonus item under, and how many bonus items a bag keeps back from
// a counter. No engine types; unit-tested in
// tests/playerbot_moonlight_rules_test.cpp. The engine's half is the chest pass
// (playerbot_consumables.h), the asking price and the floor of every counter
// line (playerbot_town.h, playerbot_offline_shop.h) and the bonus keep
// (playerbot_bonus.h).
//
// blipu, 28 September, on a hard world (the operator's answer: "A tak"): half
// an hour of a chest window, and the bots' counters held chests a player could
// buy up for next to nothing and bonus a whole set out of - "fajnie zeby boty
// faktycznie to uzywaly zamiast wystawiac za grosze na rynek". The change and
// add stones themselves never reach a counter: 71084 and 71085 carry
// ANTI_MYSHOP (and ANTI_GIVE) on both engines, for a player as much as for a
// bot. The chest carries no antiflag at all, so it was the one way out, and it
// asked Iwakura's hundred thousand for a draw that is a stone of his two
// million one time in four: 534 940 by his own sheet, at a yang rate of a
// hundred, for the group this project ships.
