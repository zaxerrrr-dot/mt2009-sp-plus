// Buying from another bot's stall, and going out of one's way to do it.
//
// The stalls existed already; nobody ever bought from one, so a well-refined
// spare sat on a counter until its keeper packed up and eventually vendored it.
// This closes the loop: a bot with money in its pocket walks the market strip
// and buys what it actually needs - a refine material it is short of, a horse
// medal, or a piece of gear better than what it is wearing.
//
// The first version only bought from a counter that happened to be within
// twenty metres of wherever the bot was standing. That is not shopping, and it
// showed: twelve purchases in half an hour across seven hundred bots, all of
// them accidents of where a town errand had left somebody. So a bot that is
// short of something now walks to the ring, picks the nearest counter with that
// something on it, walks up to that counter, and buys there - which is also
// what a market is supposed to look like from the outside.
//
// It reads the offer from the seller's own AI state rather than from CShop,
// whose item list is private. That is not a workaround: we are the ones who put
// the items on the counter, in that order, so the recorded offer is exactly
// what is on it and its index is the index CShopManager::Buy expects.
//
// The purchase itself goes through the engine's ordinary path. Setting the shop
// owner is what a client does when a player clicks a stall, and everything
// after it - the price, the gold, the inventory space, moving the item - is the
// engine's own code, so a bot cannot buy anything a player could not.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: it
// defines objects, relies on the engine headers playerbot_manager.cpp includes
// above it, and reopens the same anonymous namespace. Include it exactly once,
// after playerbot_town.h - that file puts the goods on the counters and owns
// the walk into town this one borrows.
