// A visit to town, from the gate to the last errand: which NPCs this trip is
// for and in what order, walking each leg, the Biologist, and setting up a
// market stall.
//
// A town visit is a small state machine because it has to survive being
// interrupted - a bot that is teleported, killed, or simply loses its route
// mid-errand must be able to pick the trip up rather than start it again. The
// phase in TPlayerBotAIState is that memory, and every branch here either
// advances it or ends the visit.
//
// The stall is engine state with an AI deadline, so releasing one runs at the
// very top of the tick, ahead of everything that could claim it - see
// ManagePlayerBotShopLifetime and the comment in CPlayerBotManager::Update.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: it
// defines objects, relies on the engine headers playerbot_manager.cpp includes
// above it, and reopens the same anonymous namespace. Include it exactly once,
// after playerbot_travel.h - that file decides a town trip is due, this one
// carries it out.
