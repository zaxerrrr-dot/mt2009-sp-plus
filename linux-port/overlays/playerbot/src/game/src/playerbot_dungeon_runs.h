// MT2009_PLUS_BOT_DUNGEON_RUNS_V1 - the bots' own dungeon runs (the engine half).
//
// The owner, 4 October: "Do wersji na githuba niech wszystkie boty lataja na
// dungeony zgodnie ze swoimi lvl, niech zwoluja sobie party i chodza
// normalnie". It reverses the rule of 30 September ("no bot in the new
// dungeons", IsPlayerBotOffLimitsMap) for these runs and these runs alone: a
// bot on its own still never wanders onto the Arezzo maps (the Arezzo rules
// of 1 October stay), and every move below is let through the Arezzo and
// Ochao routes by IsPlayerBotDungeonRunMove.
//
// A run, end to end:
//
//   - the choice (PlanPlayerBotDungeonRun, every PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_PLAN_MS): one
//     pass over this core's bots files each free one under the dungeons whose
//     level band it is in - the dungeon's level to fifteen above it, the
//     dungeon finder's (playerbot_dungeon_lfg.h) - and whose rest it is out of:
//     the dungeon's own cooldown (dungeon_info.txt's quest flag and seconds,
//     the one a player's entry sets), the quests' five expeditions a day
//     (<quest>.day / <quest>.runs, a player's), and a rest of its own after
//     every run (PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_REST_*). Free is what the finder says
//     (GetPlayerBotLfgRefusal: no companion, mercenary, shouter, cohort, raid,
//     war, duel, stall, market, fishing, mining, person's party, retirement,
//     AFK, a person's LFG wait...), a weapon and an armour on, and a share of
//     the bots by personality (PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_SHARE_*): a merchant seldom
//     goes. A dungeon and a kingdom with PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_CALL_MIN such bots
//     are drawn, within the caps (a dungeon's own, one Demon Tower run at a
//     time and none while a guild raids it, PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_MAX_RUNS for the
//     core, more with more bots), and a kingdom's shout carries one call per
//     PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_SHOUT_GAP_MS.
//   - the call: the party is drawn (playerbot_dgrun::PickParty: 4-8 by the
//     dungeon's limits, no class more than its third, a Shaman when one is
//     free); its first is the leader, who shouts the call on the kingdom's
//     shout - "szukam pt na biblioteke 30-45 lvl, kto chetny?" - and the
//     others answer over the next half a minute, a couple of them aloud ("ja",
//     "biore", "wbijam, 52 sura wp"), each one looked at again as it answers.
//   - the gathering: each goes to its own spot round the entrance - the
//     dungeon panel's entrance for its kingdom (ResolvePlayerBotLfgPlace, so a
//     Classic core without the row, or with the Arezzo module closed, never
//     calls one), the Metin of Toughness's ground floor for the Demon Tower -
//     by the map change every move of the AI is, and waits there drinking and
//     fighting off what comes; the leader makes the party there (a party is
//     one kingdom's, as the engine wants). Everybody there, or
//     PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_GATHER_MS gone with PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_START_MIN there: in;
//     too few: the leader says so ("nikt nie przyszedl, rozwiazuje pt") and
//     the party goes.
//   - the way in: what the guard's dialog does for a player is done here, as
//     the Arezzo cohort does it - a new instance of the dungeon, the party
//     jumped in at the quest's entry point (WarpSet through WarpBot, which
//     keeps the party), the saved way out set to the gathering spot - and the
//     quest's own start asked for through its server timer "<x>_dgrun", which
//     runs init() for an instance carrying the dungeon flag "mt2009_dgrun"
//     (nothing a player can set). A player's price is paid: the cooldown flag,
//     the day's count and the entry fee (when the bot holds three of it -
//     the fee of a poorer one is let go, logged as fee=0). Unlike the cohort's,
//     such a run keeps the player's time limit, end countdown and way out.
//     The Demon Tower is entered the tower's way: the party breaks the
//     Metin of Toughness and the quest jumps everybody on the ground floor in.
//   - inside: the Arezzo dungeons (Wukong, Skorpion, Dzungla) are fought by
//     the cohort's plan (ManagePlayerBotArzDgInside: the stage's targets, the
//     wave camp, the seals, the pack's middle given by this run), the Demon
//     Tower by the tower's floors (ManagePlayerBotDemonTower, which takes any
//     bot in its instance), and the rest by a leader and a pack: the leader
//     goes for the stage's objective (DrivePlayerBotDgRunLeader: the
//     Biblioteka's Metins, Queens and Baroness; Razador's Ignitor, Metin and
//     Razador; Nemere's Metin, Szels, Pillar and Nemere; the Blue Dragon's four
//     stones before him), else the nearest monster; the others fight round it
//     (FightPlayerBotPartyDungeon - what attacks them or the leader, what the
//     leader fights, the stones, the nearest). The dungeons' items are the
//     party dungeon pass's (ManagePlayerBotPdgItems: the seals and keys used,
//     Razador's cog and Maat stones and Nemere's crystals handed in), and the
//     two dialogs a leader would answer - Razador's statue, Nemere's lion - are
//     the quests' "<x>_dgrun_next" server timers. Between the fights the bots
//     loot as they do anywhere (HandleLoot); a boss in a bots' instance does
//     not heal back what it lost (HoldPlayerBotArzDgBossRegen).
//   - the way out: the quest's own end (the last boss's countdown, or its
//     time limit) and d.exit_all; whoever is still inside after it, or after
//     PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_STALL_MS without progress, PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_MAX_WIPES
//     wipes or the time limit and a margin, is warped out here - no bot is
//     ever left in an instance. Out on an Arezzo map or in the Temple of Ochao
//     (the Jungle's way out is the Las) a bot is sent back to where it stood
//     before the call. The leader may say how it went ("gg, zaliczylismy
//     razadora"), the party goes, and every member rests.
//
// The switch: the DUNGEONS key of playerbot_weights.tsv (the Seban panel's
// "Dungeony botow"), on by default, and the FILE playerbot_dungeon_runs_off
// in the core's directory, which turns it off whatever the panel says. Off:
// no new call; the runs under way end as they would.
//
// The operator's hook: a file "playerbot_dungeon_runs_test" in the core's
// directory, read every few seconds and renamed to .done:
//     now <key|any>           a call now (biblioteka, wieza, wukong, razador,
//                             skorpion, nemere, smok, dzungla), off the clock;
//     abort <key|all>         those runs out now;
//     status                  one BOT_DGRUN status line per dungeon.
//
// The log: BOT_DGRUN lines in syslog (called, answered, gathered, entered,
// stage, finished, stalled, abandoned, wipe, out, closed, status; and from V2
// break-off, regrouped, fallback, fallback over, cure, leader holds) and one row
// a run in playerbot_dungeon_runs.tsv: unix time, run, dungeon, instance,
// kingdom, members, lowest and highest level, result (finished, timeout,
// abandoned, wipe, left, lost, disbanded, no_stone, aborted), seconds, the
// stage reached, each stage's seconds, deaths, wipes, the fees paid, the
// leader and the names.
//
// Not here: the Devil's Catacomb, which needs the tower's ninth floor and a
// Dried Head and has its own party raids of bots (playerbot_catacomb.h); the
// Monkey and Spider Dungeons, open maps the bots hunt anyway; a person
// answering the call (people form their own parties with the dungeon finder).
//
// MT2009_PLUS_BOT_DUNGEON_RUNS_V2 - the first night's lesson (4/5 October,
// the test server: Razador 114 runs and none won, Nemere 78 and one; 24 198
// deaths, 1.25 a bot a minute). Read from BOT_DGRUN and PLAYERBOT_AI lines:
//   - a death loop, not a fight: a bot stood up where it fell after ten
//     seconds, rested to three quarters invisible a thousand units off in a
//     direction its pid drew - into the next group as often as not - and went
//     back at the same monsters: the median time between two deaths of one
//     bot was 29 s, 94% of them came within a minute of the one before;
//   - the leader pulled the room: every monster of 351/352 sees twenty
//     metres (aggressive_sight 2000), a room holds 48-60 of them back after a
//     minute, and the leader went for the nearest wherever the others were - a
//     Shaman of 68 lost 3 600 of its 9 280 health in two seconds, potions
//     (1 200 a draught, one a second) and all;
//   - the break-off at a fifth of health came too late: 58% (Razador) and 53%
//     (Nemere) of the deaths came with no target, in the second between the
//     break-off and the invisibility that protects a recovering bot;
//   - too few and too weak: a third of the parties went in with four, the
//     bots' gear is twenty levels behind them (75-79: weapons of 48, armour of
//     44 on average), and the Shaman's Cure waited for 60% health.
// Hence (the band and the party size are the rules' - RUN_RULES):
//   - KeepPlayerBotDgRunAlive: drink at 85%, break off at 30% invisible at
//     once, and a fallen or broken-off bot walks back to its pack invisible
//     (to the leader, or to the run's camp - the last spot where the pack
//     stood with no monster within PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_QUIET_RANGE) and fights again
//     only healed to 85% and there, as the Demon Tower's bots do;
//   - the leader pulls nothing new while fewer than two of the others stand
//     by it or its own health is under PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_LEADER_HOLD_HP - it
//     fights what is already on the party and waits;
//   - the fallback (wipe protection): fewer than half of those inside fit
//     to fight, and everybody standing goes back to the camp and fights only
//     what follows, until three quarters are fit again or
//     PLAYERBOT_DGRUN_FALLBACK_MAX_MS is up;
//   - the Shaman's Cure first: the run's most hurt under 75% before anything.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes:
// include it once, after playerbot_dungeon_lfg.h (whose places, words and
// refusal it borrows), and so after the party dungeon pass, the Arezzo
// cohort and the tower, whose fights and items it uses.
