// Herbalism: Baek-Go's crafting board, worked without his window.
//
// The 2.x package ships the whole system and this world has never used a line
// of it. Read off the running server on 17 September: the onboarding quest is
// compiled and hooked to mob 20018 in all three first villages, his special
// shop 14 sells the Herbalist's Knife and the three empty bottles, and
// world.crafting_proto carries 77 rows behind eight levels of recipe knowledge.
// What it produced in game was nothing at all - the recipes that drop from
// Metin stones (29 groups at 12.5-18%) went to the merchant as an unknown
// item, and the herbs went on the counters as bulk goods.
//
// Three engine facts decide the shape of what follows:
//
//   * The board is a CLIENT WINDOW. crafting.open sends `craft_open` down the
//     chat channel and crafting.create refuses anything unless that window
//     reported itself open, so a bot - which has no client - can never press a
//     single button on it. The craft is therefore re-implemented here against
//     CCraftingManager, the way the stable keeper's hand-over and the ore
//     smelting already are. Everything it touches is the quest's own: the same
//     rows, the same odds, the same price, and the same progress flags
//     (`crafting.progress_<recipe>`), so a bot and a player are counted by one
//     ledger and the panel reads both the same way.
//   * A craft SPENDS THE MATERIALS WHETHER IT SUCCEEDS OR NOT - crafting.lua
//     removes them before it rolls - so a 60% row is a real loss and a bot
//     keeps PLAYERBOT_HERBALISM_GOLD_RESERVE rather than grinding its purse.
//   * A potion is ITEM_POTION (type 36), a type of its own on this line, and
//     its use goes through the compiled quest hook `object/36/use_type`, not
//     through any case in char_item.cpp. So a bot drinks one with an ordinary
//     UseItem and the quest does the rest: value0 is the duration, value1 the
//     group (boost 1, offensive 2, defensive 3) and the engine allows 5, 3 and
//     2 affects of those groups at once.
//
// What is deliberately NOT here: picking the plants. The knife wants a growing
// bush to click and this world spawns four of the sixteen - the Alpine Rose in
// the three second villages, the Thistle on Mount Sohan, the Amber Petal and
// the Nettle on the two Trent maps - none of them the Peach Blossom the
// onboarding asks for. That is the mining problem again (no map spawns a vein
// either) and placing plants is a change of its own. The herbs a bot works
// with come from the drop tables, where all of them are: the bags and counters
// of the test world held 2788 of them before a single line of this ran.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: include
// it exactly once, after playerbot_mining.h - it uses the free-cell count and
// the gold reserve - and before playerbot_economy.h, whose junk rule asks it
// what a potion and a recipe are worth keeping.
