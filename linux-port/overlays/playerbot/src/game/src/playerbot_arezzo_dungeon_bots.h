// MT2009_PLUS_AREZZO_DUNGEON_BOTS_V1 - the operator's test cohort for the three
// Arezzo dungeons (the owner, 1 October: "Zrob specjalnie boty po 30 sztuk na
// 3 nowe dungi Arezzo ... niech biegaja w kolko", the test server only):
//
//   * Wzgorze Wukonga (364, wzgorze_wukonga.quest): three waves of 60 monkeys,
//     each ending in the Seal of the Hill (30766) the last killer uses; 6 Hill
//     Stones (9701); 3 Cloud Defenders (9683); 4 Phoenix Eggs (9702); the
//     Flaming Phoenix (9684); WuKong (9682);
//   * Ruiny Skorpiona (365, ruiny_skorpiona.quest): three waves of 50
//     scorpions (seal 30767); 6 Scorpion Metins (9696); 3 Red Scorpions
//     (9695); 4 Scorpion Metins (9696); the Scorpion King (9694);
//   * Starozytna Dzungla (366, starozytna_dzungla.quest): three waves of 40
//     (seal 30768); 6 Ancient Stones (9710); 3 Faethorns (9712); 4 Primeval
//     Stones (9711); the Royal Owl (9713); the Jungle Queen (9714).
//
// Every stage is fought in one open arena round the guard's spot (all of it
// one walkable piece: tools/arezzo_dungeon_map.py measured every regen, stone
// and boss point from the entry), so the plan of a run is the quests' own
// stage flag and a target list per stage: what attacks the bot, then the
// stage's objective (the stones, the defenders, the eggs, the boss), then
// the nearest monster - and the seal used as soon as a squad member holds it.
//
// Where: the cohort lives on the core that hosts the dungeons, since a bot
// cannot cross cores - game2 until MT2009_PLUS_BOT_DUNGEONS_ALL_V1 moved 364-366
// onto game1 beside every bot (m2-render-config), game1 since; nothing here
// names the core, the watch asks SECTREE_MANAGER. Each character's
// save point is the dungeon map itself, beside its guard - the lobby the
// quests already have for a player whose one-load entry falls back
// ("Otworz przejscie", map 364/365/366 not in an instance). The cohort file
// "playerbot_arezzo_dungeon_cohort.txt" ("<wukong|skorpion|dzungla> <pid>"
// a line) is read on the core that hosts the maps (its bots are logged in on
// top of the hosting core's own population) and on every other core, which
// refuses those pids (CPlayerBotManager::Spawn), so no character is loaded
// twice. tools/arezzo_dungeon_cohort.py picks and equips the characters.
//
// Off its map: on game1 the dungeons' neighbours are hosted too, so what game2
// could never do now happens - the quests' login sends a bot found on the
// lobby map to the dungeon's exit (the Fire Land, Hwang; the Las is refused),
// the Arezzo module's send-off (M2_AREZZO=0, the test server's setting) to
// its town, a stranded recovery to M2. Such a bot is warped home to its
// lobby (the route lets the cohort onto its own dungeon's map alone,
// RoutePlayerBotArezzoTransition) and the module's send-off leaves the cohort
// on its own dungeon's map alone (playerbot_arezzo.h): the test is the
// operator's, a closed module keeps players and the other bots out. Should
// the way home stay shut (PLAYERBOT_ARZDG_HOME_TRIES refusals in a row), the
// bot is logged once with the refusal and left to the ordinary AI - it hunts
// instead of standing on the exit in a heap with the rest - and asked home
// again every PLAYERBOT_ARZDG_HOME_RELEASED_MS.
//
// The run: bots of one kingdom gather in the lobby in fives (a Shaman's buffs
// reach its own kingdom only); a squad, or whoever has waited
// PLAYERBOT_ARZDG_SQUAD_WAIT_MS, goes in. What the guard's "Wejdz" does is
// done here server-side - a new instance of the map, the squad jumped into it
// at the quest's entry point (WarpSet, which moves a bot through WarpBot),
// the save point set to the lobby - and the quest's own start is asked for
// through its server timer "<x>_dgbot", which runs init() for an instance
// carrying the dungeon flag "mt2009_dgbot" (nothing a player can set). Such
// an instance has no time limit (the quests' tick leaves its minutes alone),
// no fee and no daily limit (no guard, no login payment), and its end sends
// the squad back to the lobby instead of the entry map. After a pause it goes
// in again, for as long as the cohort file names it.
//
// The test hook, for the operator: a file "playerbot_arezzo_dungeon_test" in
// the hosting core's directory:
//     cohort                  read the cohort file again and log its bots in;
//     stop <key|all>          no new runs of that dungeon (the running end);
//     start <key|all>         new runs again;
//     abort <key|all>         every squad of it out to the lobby now;
//     status                  one ARZ_DG line per dungeon.
// The watch writes ARZ_DG lines to syslog (entered, stage, seal, finished,
// stalled, abandoned, died, wipe, stuck), one row per run to
// playerbot_arezzo_dungeon_runs.tsv and the cohort's state to
// playerbot_arezzo_dungeon_track.tsv every 30 s.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes:
// include it once, after playerbot_catacomb.h (the fight is the tower's).

	// the timer again; a stage of 2..N with none of its objective races on the
