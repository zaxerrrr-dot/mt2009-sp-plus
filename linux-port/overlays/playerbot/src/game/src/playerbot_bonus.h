// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: include

	// than the one it replaced, and until now nothing ever looked at them.
	//
	// The scoring below is deliberately coarse. It exists to tell "worth keeping"
	// from "roll it again", not to model the damage formula: every line is scored
	// as points-per-typical-roll so that a +2000 HP line and a +15 attack line
	// can be compared at all.

	// Three of the world's own tables decide it and none of it is taste. A
	// player sent in a spreadsheet of "which bonus is worth having on which
	// piece, on which map"; this is that spreadsheet checked against our files,
	// which disagree with it in several places worth knowing about.
	//
	//  * `player.item_attr` says what may roll where and how high. Health does
	//    not roll on a helmet or an earring, critical does not roll on a wrist
	//    or an earring, attack value rolls on a body and nowhere else, and
	//    block only on a shield. That is why the finishing rule below is per
	//    slot: the old one asked a helmet for health and attack value, so no
	//    helmet in the world could ever be finished and every one of them was
	//    rerolled for as long as its owner had gold.
	//  * `battle.cpp` says what a line does. BLOCK stops a melee hit outright
	//    and 73% of this world's monsters are melee. DODGE and RESIST_BOW only
	//    answer a ranged attacker, and ranged monsters are 0-24% of a map. An
	//    elemental resistance is applied at thirty percent of its own number,
	//    so fifteen points of it is four and a half percent. And the five
	//    weapon-type resistances never fire against a monster at all: that
	//    branch reads the attacker's WEAR_WEAPON and a monster wears none, so
	//    "odpornosc na miecze" is a line for fighting players.
	//  * `tools/analyse_map_races.py` says what each map is made of, which is
	//    what makes a race line worth having - or not, on the three maps whose
	//    monsters no item can be strong against.
