// What a bot decides to do with the next few minutes of its life.
//
// This used to be one chain of else-ifs at the top of the manager, which read
// well but could only ever be changed by rebuilding the image: the order was
// the policy. It is now a list of candidates, each with a base priority and a
// weight the operator can move in the panel while the world runs.
//
// The base priorities are spaced ten apart and listed in exactly the order the
// old chain tested, so with every weight at its neutral 100 this picks the same
// goal the chain did, every time. That property is the whole point - the file
// is a tuning surface, not a rewrite - and it is what makes it safe to ship the
// weights to a world with hundreds of bots already living in it.
//
// Three things stay outside the vote, because they are not preferences:
// surviving a fight that is going badly, choosing a profession at level 5, and
// finding a weapon when holding none. A weight that could suppress those would
// not be a slider, it would be a way to break the server from a web form.
