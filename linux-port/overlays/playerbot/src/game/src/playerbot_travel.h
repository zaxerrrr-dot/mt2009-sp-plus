// Where a bot ought to be, and how it gets there across maps.
//
// Two things live here that look separate and are not. The first is what a bot
// still needs - potions, a weapon, a repair - because that is what decides
// whether it may leave for a hunting ground at all. The second is the crossing
// itself: which frontier suits its level, when a trip is worth making, and the
// difference between a warp and a walk to a portal.
//
// A server-side bot has no client to reconnect, so it cannot cross between game
// cores. Every route planned here has to stay on the cores that host its maps.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: it
// defines objects, relies on the engine headers playerbot_manager.cpp includes
// above it, and reopens the same anonymous namespace. Include it exactly once,
// after playerbot_movement.h - it decides the destination, that file walks to
// it - and after playerbot_economy.h, whose refine opportunities it consults.
